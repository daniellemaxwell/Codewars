**Codewars Challenges**
A repository of completed solutions to daily Codewars challenges. I push solutions to 7 challenges each week.

**Link to Codewars Profile:** https://www.codewars.com/users/daniellemaxwell

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

I solve at least one Codewars challenge each day.

## Optimizations
I refactor code as I learn new ways to make my code more efficient and readable.  

## Lessons Learned:

Practice makes improvements. The more I work on challenges the better I become at thinking about how to solve problems before I begin coding a solution.
